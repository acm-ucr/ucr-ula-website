Which is why I really wanted to become a ULA, because I wanted nothing more than to return a little bit of the kindness I received back into the UCR community. A little fun fact about myself is that over the pandemic I began teaching myself how to play the harmonica, and so far I’ve been enjoying it quite a lot!",
